 * control frames (flow control, resets, pings, close) always preempt stream
 * data, and among stream data the highest `sendOrder` wins (W3C WebTransport
 * convention — larger value is sent first), with round-robin among equal
 * priorities. Prioritization only bites under backpressure; when the sink has
 * room every frame is written as soon as it's queued.
 *
 * The backpressure source is abstracted behind {@link SendSink} so we can use
 * `WebSocketStream`'s real (event-driven) backpressure where available and fall
 * back to polling `WebSocket.bufferedAmount` everywhere else.
